## IK in Unity
This university exercise implements Gradient Descent, CCD and FABRIK IK algorithms. 
The objective of this exercise is a culmination of previous works, where a spider's legs have to be controlled using FABRIK, the  spider's tails controlled with Gradient Descent, and an octopus arms controlled with CCD.

We were given a starting unity project with some boilerplate code already setup, but all algorithms were implemented by me. 
This exercise was graded with a 10.

The algorithms were implemented in a separate DLL found in the OctopusController directory.

Unity Version: 2020.3.14f1
